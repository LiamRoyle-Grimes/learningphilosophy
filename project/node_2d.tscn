I believe that Empathy is one of the most important aspects of teaching and possibly one of the most important values that directed me towards my current possition as a learning assistant. I usually hear empathy defined as \"being able to relate to someone elses feelings\" or \"imagine yourself in their position\" but I think that these are incomplete forms of empathy. To really exemplify empathy I think one must acknowledge that you don't know the internal expiriences of others and you won't always be able to relate to them. Thus empathy is really accepting this and trying to help based on what you do know. 

This relates directly to learning becase everyone struggles with learning material to some degree. Assuming that  that degree is the same for me as it is for everyone else would not be a productive or healthy atitude. One of the things that I found appealing about the Learning assistant position Is that I benifitted from having peer mentors in the past so becoming one myself would let me return the favor for those in a simular position to me. But I found it even more compelling that I might be able to help someone who needs such an interaction more than I did."

UDL suggests ways that practitioners can guide goal seting, strategic planing, steps that are critical for solving any problem.  Using the prescriptions of UDL an instuctor might demonstrate a problem so that students know what an end solution would look like. Then the instructor might provide a problem solving template for the students to structure their work as they go.

One of my favorite parts of UDL is that it is based on providing options rather than forcing students to aproach course material in one specific way. I believe that this sentement is an excelent way to acknowledge the uniqueness of students. Not every student is going to find the strategy I use to be the best way to aproach a problem so providing many options is likely to be a better way for students to find the strategies that work for them.

One important detail to consider when facilitating colaborative comuinication is the effects on Inclusion caused by the methods withwhich groups are constructed.

However, this creates the risk of alienating students that do not have preexisting social networks in the class. This would run contrary to my long term goal of facilitating [color=green]comunication[/color].

I do not yet know if I want to be an eucator as a significant part of my career but I do know that comunicating technical concepts will be an important part of my career.one of the things that I have already noticed is that I am much more comfortable speaking about technical conscepts to larger audiances. I have also gained an understanding of the current course material to the point where I feel Like I can explain it.(weather I can do this successfully will require a less biased form of assessment) In the future I would like to focus on growing my ability to teach more indirectly. I do not currently have a good intuition on when to deflect questions and when to answer them directly. This is an obvious area of growth."

One piece of data that I have already observed is that the section of Calc I where I am assisting is generally performing better than thea vaerage among all classes. This makes me feel that I am at least not hindering the Active learning proces. In the Feuture I would like to conduct a SOTL(Scholarship of Teaching and Learning) study based on some of my specific strategies to determine if they are actually useful contributions or an inefficient use of class time compared to quicker methods of instruction."

In class  we spent some time examining the neuroscience related to  learning. I believe that the most important takeaway from this lesson wasn't necessarily the ways that I can incorporate this neuroscience into teaching but rather that students should be made aware of this information directly. I have been told that exercise is “good for your brain” before but I always assumed that this was some inexplicable effect of an increase in general health.I was also under the impression that it wasn’t that strong of an effect. I was even aware that chronic stress was generally unhealthy, but I didn’t realize how much of a direct detriment to learning it could be. After learning about this in the active learning seminar I realise that it would have been enormously beneficial if I had learned these details earlier in my educational career. I think that learning about this science directly would be far more helpful to students than any strategies I can implement in the classroom based on Neuroscience.
